# A rotation callback may not consume a resource the named contract lends

`steal` reads only the old augmentation cell, but its contract consumes
`shape(old)`. `AugmentRotate` hands the callback a view of the rebuilt shape and
ownership of two cells; it never transfers a subtree away. A concrete contract
that takes ownership the named contract does not supply cannot satisfy it, so
`AugmentRotate(&steal)` never forms.

struct node {
    struct node *left;
    struct node *right;
    int32 augmented;
};

                         void (*augment_rotate)(struct node *old, struct node *new)) {
    struct node *pivot = node->right;
    struct node *middle = pivot->left;
    node->right = middle;
    pivot->left = node;
    augment_rotate(node, pivot);
    return pivot;
}

void bump(struct node *old, struct node *new) { new->augmented = old->augmented + 1; }

void steal(struct node *old, struct node *new) { new->augmented = old->augmented; }

    return rotate_left(node, &steal);
